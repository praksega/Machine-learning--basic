Machine Learning for Cancer Prediction

This collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

BRCA-Breast invasive carcinoma

COAD-Colon adenocarcinoma

KIRC-kidney renal clear cell carcinoma

LUAD-lung adenocarcinoma

PRAD-prostrate adenocarcinoma

Samples (instances) are stored row-wise. Variables (attributes) of each sample are RNA-Seq gene expression levels measured by illumina HiSeq platform.

The data is available here on the link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq

The Data Tells us the model has 95%+ accuracy on predicting the type of tumor.

The Accuracy of the Algorithms is given below.

1. Random Forest - 92.74%
2. Logistic Regression - 99.2%
3. SVC - 99.9%
4. KNN - 74.5%
5. Decision Tree - 55.77%
